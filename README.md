# An updated generic concept for *Muscari* s.l. using genome wide SNP data

Here I document the the assembly of double-digest restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (ddRAD) data set for the geophyte genus *Muscari*, currently accepted for publication in Taxon as follows:

**BÃ¶hnert T**, **Neumann M**, **Quandt D**, **Weigend M**. *accpt*. Phylogeny based generic reclassification of *Muscari* sensu lato (Asparagaceae) using plastid and genomic DNA. ***Taxon***.

A second notebook documents the tree plotting of additional phylogentic trees from cholorplast data.

The grape hyacinth (***Muscari*** Mill.) represents an important ornamental plant group in Asparagaceae subfamily Scilloideae, comprising some 80 species distributed mainly in the Mediterranean. However, genus delimitation has repeatedly shifted over the past two centuries and a general consensus has not been reached so far.
